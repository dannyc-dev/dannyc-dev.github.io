        'desc': `You've probably heard of this one, I got it as a holiday gift and finished it in just a few nights. It tells the story of the Locke siblings on their return to their ancestral home of Keyhouse following their father’s gruesome murder. Keyhouse is filled with it's own special twist, filled with dark doors and the magic keys that open them. Oh and also home to a malicious presence that will stop at nothing in it’s quest for the Omega Key and the unspeakable prize it unlocks. Pretty fun read with incredible art.`,

It tells the story of Kenji Endō and his friends, who notice a cult-leader known only as "Friend" is out to destroy the world, and it has something to do with their childhood memories. The story follows Kenji on his search to find the truth and plenty of drama and plot twists along the way. Overall, this was my first experience with a manga series and I totally get the hype. Super fun series with a compelling story line and awesome art, really fell in love with this one.`,
